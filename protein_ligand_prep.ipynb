    "This is part 1 of a three-part tutorial on molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecular systems prepared for *CompBioAsia* 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is concerned with preparing a molecular system for MD simulation.\n",
    "A second part covers actually running MD simulations, using the **AMBER** package.\n",
    "A third part looks at another MD package - **OpenMM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Assuming you have started this Notebook using the `run_notebook.sh` script in this folder, your Python environment should be complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "One of the most widespread uses of molecular dynamics simulations is to predict protein-ligand binding affinities, a key process in drug design and discovery. This requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A three dimensional model for the ligand - most commonly this can be **predicted from first principles**.\n",
    "2. A three dimensional model for the protein - this may be predicted from first principles sometimes (e.g. **Alphafold** or similar), but most commonly makes use of experimental methods such as **Xray crystallography** or **NMR spectroscopy**.\n",
    "3. A prediction of where on the protein the ligand binds - often obtained via the molecular modelling method of **Docking**.\n",
    "4. The production of a molecular model for the protein-ligand complex, and conversion into a form that is ready for MD simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is concerned with parts 1,2, and 4 of this process - the Docking part will be discussed at another time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the first part you will learn how to produce a molecular model for an analogue the anicancer drug [Imatinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib). \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the second part you will learn how to produce a molecular model of the protein target, the [Abl tyrosine kinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABL_(gene)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* In part three (skipping over the docking bit), you will see how to combine the model of the protein with the molecular model for the ligand generated in part one, and complete the preparation of the system for molecular dynamics simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very many approaches to system preparation for MD, what you see here is just one of them. It leverages a number of different system preparation tools from different sources, so to make the process simpler these have been \"wrapped\" into a small number of Python functions in the package *cba_tools*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see the details, take a look at `cba_tools.py`!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**:\n",
    "This tutorial is adapted from CCPBioSim's [BioSim analysis workshop](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/BioSim-analysis-workshop).\n",

    "We begin by creating a model for our chosen ligand. If you are starting - as here - from nothing, then a good way to do this can be to work out a description of its structure in [SMILES format](https://daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html), and then apply tools that can generate a 3D model of the molecule from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In doing this, one of the things you need to consider carefuly is the likely **protonation state** of your ligand. For example, if it contains basic amino groups, most likely at physiological pHs these will be protonated. If on the other hand it contains carboxylic acid groups, most likely these will be deprotonated. \n",

    "![boxes](boxes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Box\" adds the least solvent to satisfy the \"buffer\" criterion (white arrows), but if the solute (orange) rotates in the box, it may extend beyond it. \"Cube\" solves this, but means adding more water (so more atoms and a slower simulation). \"Oct\" reduces the number of waters required but still is safe for rotation of the solute.\n",
