    "The Protein Data Bank ([PDB](www.rcsb.org)) is a very valuable source of structures for MD simulation, but it must be understood that the crystal structure data itself is really just raw material - there are typically many steps that must be taken in order to generate simulation-ready systems from it. Some of these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The crystal structure may contain more data than is needed for the simulation (e.g. multiple copies of the protein) - it may need to be edited down.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Almost certainly the crystal structure will have missing data. It possible that certain heavy atoms - maybe whole sections of the protein - were not resolved in the experiment and are missing. Molecular simulations require chemically-complete models for the components so this must be rectified.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Even if the structure is complete at the heavy-atom level, if it was solved by Xray crystallography it is unlikely that any hydrogen atoms will have been resolved. so these missing atoms must be added as well.\n",
